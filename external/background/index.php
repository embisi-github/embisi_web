The embedded controller space has a number of players, from companies that have been developing 8-bit microcontrollers and 16-bit microcontrollers to companies that feel that 32-bit embedded CPUs are suitable embedded controllers. Applications vary from the sub-dollar system (including packaging, board, and batteries) to many thousands of dollars (excluding gas-fired power station).

<p>

Small embedded microcontrollers have limited performance, in terms of MIPs, software toolsets, code capability, OS capability and manageability.

<p>

Large embedded CPU-based controllers overcome most of the obstacles, but then lose the fine controllability of a microcontroller and the low cost achievable with small microcontrollers.
