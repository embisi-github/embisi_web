Gavin is a Briton transplanted to California&lsquo;s Bay Area, his life uprooted by the demands of the silicon industry.

<br>

He was awarded his PhD by Cambridge University, England, whilst working for his first startup called (at the time) ATML, a company which has since become Virata, Globespan/Virata, and now something to probably become Conexant.

<br>

Designing ATML&lsquo;s first system-on-a-chip (i.e. integrated CPU
with networking functions) took him to work with Cirrus Logic
in Fremont, California, where he eventually took up employment,
working as the architect for Cirrus Logic&lsquo;s communications silicon division.
This division spun off to become Basis Communications, a privately held communication silicon vendor, of which Gavin was Chief Technical Officer.

<br>

Upon completion of the design of its first silicon, Basis was acquired
by Intel Corporation, where it was taken under the wing of the Network
Processor Group. Here, Gavin held a post as an architect for the lower
end of the network processor line, being chiefly responsible for the
architecture of the IXP425 amongst other devices. Gavin left Intel in
March 2003, and having spent quite some time on the Cyclicity cycle
design language is now developing the architecture for the Embisi
silicon and software.
