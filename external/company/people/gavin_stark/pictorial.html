<h2>Gavin J Stark, the history</h2>

This pages is a descriptive view of how I have got to be who I am. For
those who find this too verbose, I have <a href="resume.html">a
resume</a>.

<H3>The earlier years</H3>

I was born in Burwell, which is just far enough inside Cambridgeshire
for me to be considered born and bred in that county, although if I lived
there I would be tempted to describe it as rural Suffolk. My first memories
are of Ely, where I spent my primary school years at St.Etheldreda's and
St.Mary's. I skipped the fourth year at St.Mary's, moving on to Queen Elizabeth's
Hospital (QEH) in Bristol as a boarder. After recovering from the shock
of displacement, I spent seven happy years amongst some wonderful people,
and most of my skills were developed there.

<H3>University and the first commerical steps</H3>

Another chapter of my life began in 1986 on entry to <A target="_top" HREF="http://www.christs.cam.ac.uk">Christ's
College, Cambridge</A>, to read Mathematics and Computing Science. The
course is mainly theoretical, but covers every aspect of computing that
can be mentioned. This led to a first-class degree in 1990, from where
I moved on to work at <A target="_top" HREF="http://www.acorn.co.uk">Acorn Computers</A>,
fulfilling a childhood dream, writing low-level software for RISC OS. Discovering
that dreams are better than reality, I left to return to <A target="_top" HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge
University</A>.

<H3>Back to University</H3>

In 1991 I started a PhD in computing, under Dr. Andy Hopper. At the
time I had no idea what to do, but development of network software for
the Pandora system was presented as a possibility. (The Pandora system
is one of the many wondrous ideas at <A target="_top"
HREF="http://www.orl.co.uk">Olivetti Research Laboraory</A>.) This
grew into time distribution, network hardware, performance evaluation,
and myriads of other aspects of networking for multimedia systems. The
<A target="_top"
href="http://www.cantabds.demon.co.uk/thesis/index.html">PhD
dissertation</a> was mainly written by March 1994, when I moved back
to the commercial world.


<H3><A target="_top" HREF="http://www.atml.co.uk">ATML</A>, the first year</H3>

The commercial world I entered this time was in the form of a start-up,
Advanced Telecommunication Modules Limited, as an ASIC design engineer.
The company was formed to commercially exploit some of ORL's research,
in the form of ATM-connected modules, but the first task of the company
was to develop the ATM network marketplace. So I developed the specification
for three ASICs, which would, in connection with an ARM processor, produce
a four chip ISA network interface card. One of the ASICs would also be
used in the switching system, so the specification for portions of that
ASIC were jointly developed with David Milway (who wants his name on the
internet more, so here it is). Starting in March of 1994, I completed the
specifications, chose the CAD tools to use, designed the first ASIC and
sent it for layout by August 1994. These timescales were tight (er, very),
and would not have been achieved without a good silicon library and toolset
from Silicon Architects, now of <A target="_top" HREF="http://www.synopsys.com">Synopsys</A>,
and particularly help from Tom Ferry. Silicon came back in September, and
had a couple of bugs which necessitated a respin, but for a solo, first
ASIC it was very pleasing. The other companion chips were designed by other
engingeers and took longer, but when all was in place, first products shipped.

<H3>ATML, afterwards</H3>

To achieve the initial goal of ATML a fully integrated device was required.
In January 1995 I started to design the architecture for a range of such
devices; the integration of the ARM required a silicon partner with an
ARM license, and <A target="_top" HREF="http://www.cirrus.com">Cirrus Logic</A> was chosen,
as a real partner rather than an ASIC vendor. This relationship took time
to fashion, and product with the new chip is due to ship very soon now.
However, with the development of the architecture and chip complete, I
decided it was time for fresher pastures, and have now moved on. During
this time I also completed the PhD process, with my <A target="_top" href="http://www.cantabds.demon.co.uk/thesis/index.html">dissertation entitled
'Stream Handling in Multimedia Communication Systems'</a>.

<H3>Now, and hereafter</H3>

Which brings me to now. Without the responsibility for a range of chips,
I have had a chance to breathe. Now, many of the CAD tools that EDA companies
produce appear to have been written by hardware engineers, in which case
they do the job, but in a bizarre fashion, or by software engineers, in
which case they tend not to do the job at all. Some tools really hit the
sweet spot, but the ratio of successes to failures is very small. So, with
a foot in both camps I am in the processes of developing tools for PCB
and ASIC design, which engineers should enjoy using rather than suffering.
Until my next new venture takes off, of course.
