<A NAME="8"></A>Chapter 8 : Conclusions</h1>

 With the proliferation of high speed networks, and specifically the
coming-of-age of ATM networks, real-time multimedia communication
systems are becoming a reality.  The experimental Pandora system is
now over five years old, and the lessons which it can teach in this
area need to be learned. This dissertation has exposed many of those
lessons. In addition, it has shown that just as high speed networks
enable the building of real-time multimedia communication systems,
they also enable the accurate distribution of a global clock to allow
detailed analysis of them. To fully implement such a clock
more than just the network is involved: stable hardware counters,
deterministic network driver software and precise clock sources are
required. For precise clock sources, this dissertation
has shown that the Navstar GPS system works very well in this regard,
and the growing availability of GPS receiver units increases the
availability of precise clock sources, to the extent of allowing any
small LAN to have its own local clock source and clock distribution
service.

8.1 Results of the work
</h3>
<p>


<p>
 In this dissertation the design of networking software for the Pandora
distributed multimedia system has been addressed. An implementation of
this has been detailed. Furthermore, a system for the accurate
distribution of a precise global clock has been examined, experiments
described to evaluate the expected performance if the system, and an
implementation integrated with the Pandora system described. Finally,
the combined system has been shown to be able to provide detailed
performance measurements of a distributed networking system, a
specific application of which is the Pandora system.

<p>
Overall the examination of the performance of the Pandora system
using the full distributed global clock system highlights two
areas. Firstly, the network principles described in section
<A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3">2.3</A>, to which the networking software for Pandora was
designed to conform, are good foundations on which real-time networked
multimedia can be built with confidence. Secondly, that access to a
precise, accurate global clock at any point in a real-time distributed
multimedia system is very useful if that system is to be fully
understood, particulary because it is the complex interactions between
the many parts of the system which must be studied. These two main
areas are examined in more detail below.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1"></A><h4>
8.1.1 Proposed network principles examined
</h4>
<p>


<p>
This section looks at the proposed network principles thought to be
required to be supported by a multimedia system's network subsystem
(see section <A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3">2.3</A>), the implementation of them in
Pandora's network subsystem (see chapter <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3">3</A>), and
the results of the experiments performed on Pandora (from chapter
<A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7">7</A>), to draw conclusions on their correctness,
importance and usefulness.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.1"></A><h5>
8.1.1.1 Commands, messages and control
</h5>
<p>


<p>
Principle <A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.1">2.3.1</A> draws together the
requirements for the control of the network subsystem of a Pandora
box. The implementation, in particular the handling of messages for a
debugging and remote access to the interface request/response system
described in section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.6.5">3.3.6.5</A>,
provides an invaluable path for both the management of experiments and
collection of experimental data from a Pandora system while it is
operating. This path was used for all experimental data collection in
the experiments described in chapter <A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7">7</A>.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.2"></A><h5>
8.1.1.2 Overload handling
</h5>
<p>


<p>
The network support for the requirements for overload handling (principle
<A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.2">2.3.2</A>) are hard to test, particularly on the
ATM network card because, as described in section
<A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7.4">7.4</A>, the ATM network was not a performance
bottleneck. However, the Pandora system is well regarded by users for
gentle performance degradation under overload: the overload handling
is shown to be good because of the lack of overload problems. Indeed,
as noted in section <A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7.4">7.4</A>, the video subsystem is the
performance bottleneck, and its overload characteristics are a
lowering of the frame-rate of the video, which generally passes
unnoticed.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.3"></A><h5>
8.1.1.3 Data reliability
</h5>
<p>


<p>
The requirements for data reliability (principle
<A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.4">2.3.4</A>) are met by the system. Indeed, the
system does not apparently lose any data, although this is helped by
the underlying reliability of the CFR network (section
<A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.2">3.2</A>), and the lossless nature of the ATM network when
not running near overload. The push of ATM switch vendors and the
standards body on ATM continues to be towards providing a lossless
network, particularly for constant bit-rate streams, so the
simplisitic implementation should continue to work.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.4"></A><h5>
8.1.1.4 Data buffering
</h5>
<p>


<p>
The implementation of the data buffering, with unlimited receive
buffering (see section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.5.2">3.3.5.2</A>), and with
the T4 card the transmit buffer limiting (section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.4">3.4</A>), is supposed to fulfill principle
<A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.5">2.3.5</A>. From the results in section
<A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7.3">7.3</A>, the former is not expected to have any
visible effect, as the server card is never overloaded, and therefore
will continue to sink the received data faster than it is received
over the network.

<p>
The transmit buffer limiting, however, was introduced because the CFR
network was slower than the video capture, and the buffer limiting
did indeed remove the artifacts described in section
<A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.2.3.3">2.2.3.3</A>. Once the ATM card was in use the video
capture became the bottleneck (see section <A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7.4">7.4</A>), so
the buffer limiting remains out of operation.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.5"></A><h5>
8.1.1.5 Data bandwidth
</h5>
<p>


<p>
Principle <A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.6">2.3.6</A> requires that different
bandwidth streams be supported, from under 100kbps to over 2Mbps. The
implementation, with its emphasis on low per-block overheads and no
copying of data, provides the required support, as is borne out by the
results shown in section <A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7.3.4">7.3.4</A>.

<p>
From the point of view of a user, with the CFR network subsystem the
network is a bottleneck, and this always leads to questioning of the
support for the highest possible bandwidth. Simple tests, such as
changing the ring size, show that it is the CFR network itself which
limits the bandwidth. Indeed, with the 100Mbps ATM network the
Pandora network subsystem can sink all the data produced by the rest
of the Pandora box, and still receive data from other Pandora systems
without degradation: the 100Mbps ATM network subsystem is faster than
Pandora internals, and the user's perception is that of seamless
integration with other systems.

<p>
It is worth noting that the bandwidth required by Pandora's audio
streams of 136 kbps is so small compared to the achieved network
transit rate of about 3 Mbps for audio streams that it is unlikely any
problems with the audio would ever be seen on the ATM network.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.6"></A><h5>
8.1.1.6 Data priorities
</h5>
<p>


<p>
The support for principle <A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.7">2.3.7</A> differs
between the CFR network and ATM network subsystems, with the CFR
network subsystem providing fine-grained prioritising of stream
transmission (see section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.4.3">3.3.4.3</A>),
while the 100Mbps ATM network's high bandwidth relieves the ATM
network subsystem of those requirements. Both, however, try to balance
transmission and reception by using equal priority transputer
processes at the slave transputer level, while tilting that balance
towards receive priority at the higher levels (see section
<A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.4.3">3.3.4.3</A>).

<p>
Again, as the ATM network supplies such a high bandwidth connection,
yet the Pandora internals provide less data than the network subsystem
can manage, the prioritising is not visible in the ATM network
subsystem. However, the CFR network subsystem shows the stream
prioritising to good effect; when the network becomes overloaded, the
audio streams operate well, with the video performance being degraded
as lower priority.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.7"></A><h5>
8.1.1.7 Data latency
</h5>
<p>


<p>
Principle <A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.8">2.3.8</A> specifies strict constraints for
latency of data transport. The support for these constraints include
the balance in the slave software (see section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.2">3.2</A>)
between buffering (for high bandwidth) and latency; the design
requiring no copying of data (see section
<A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.2.3">3.3.2.3</A>); latency control with selection of
the priority of streams, section
<A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.4.3">3.3.4.3</A>; a small overhead for each
block, see section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.6.5">3.3.6.5</A>.

<p>
The final result seems to be good, as the latency is low (2ms) even
for the high bandwidth video, and the perception from a user's view is
instantaneous transfer. The figure in section
<A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7.3.4">7.3.4</A> of 96 microseconds for the overhead of a
block, with 45 microseconds per cell of a block, can be used to
determine suitable block sizes for desired latencies, if necessary.

<p>
<A NAME="8.1.1.8"></A><h5>
8.1.1.8 Data jitter
</h5>
<p>


<p>
In principle <A HREF="networking_for_pandora_boxes.html#2.3.9">2.3.9</A> the jitter of a stream is
required to be small: the real value depends on the stream type (video
of significantly less than one inter-frame time, audio covered by
downstream buffering and such that the latency requirement is not
exceeded). The support for jitter control is generally implicit in the
design rather than through particular aspects of the design, but there
are some specific areas: section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.2.3">3.2.3</A>
identifies the immediate removal of receive data from the CFR chip
FIFO, which is supported by the prioritising of the CFR slave
software; the data transfer from master transputer to slave
transputer multiplexes streams, see section
<A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.4.3">3.3.4.3</A>; the reassembly process
(section <A HREF="pandora_network_software_implementation.html#3.3.5.1">3.3.5.1</A>) also maintains the multiplexing of
streams.

<p>
The outcome is that jitter in audio over ATM (section
<A HREF="results_of_pandora_experiments.html#7.3.4">7.3.4</A>) is seen to be usually within 40
microseconds, although higher values are seen (up to 100
microseconds), all of which are less than a single sample time, and
therefore will be no problem at all. Jitter in the video is larger
(150 microseconds), with the worst recorded case of 200 microseconds:
however, milliseconds of jitter are allowed.

<A NAME="8.1.2"></A><h4>
8.1.2 Accurate distribution of a precise global clock
</h4>
<p>


<p>
The widest conclusion that can be reached is that accurate access to a
precise global clock is immeasurably useful for the performance
evaluation of a distributed multimedia system. The task is not
difficult, and the precision and accuracy acheived can be good with a
simple implementation. ATM networks provide a very good distribution
mechanism and GPS is a very good clock source. It is an ideal way to
base an examination of the performance of any distributed system.

<p>
For Pandora, the clock distribution led to a much better understanding
of how the system works, and also to uncovering performance-degrading
bugs in the underlying networks. Without the accuracy of the clock
distribution, the real effectiveness of the subsystems of Pandora
would still be a mystery.

<p>
<A NAME="8.2"></A><h3>
8.2 Scope of the conclusions
</h3>
<p>


<p>
Although the network principles were derived from a detailed
examination of the Pandora system, and were tested in a network
subsystem for that system, it is believed that the network principles
defined in this thesis extend beyond Pandora, into the network
subsystems for any multimedia communication system.  Some of the
specific details are affected by the bandwidths of the data streams
that Pandora requires; others by the nature of the control structures
of Pandora, which may well not apply in other multimedia systems.
Similarly, the work performed with global clock distribution has
applications outside the Pandora world, wherever evaluation of real-time distributed systems is required.

<p>
<A NAME="8.3"></A><h3>
8.3 Further work
</h3>
<p>


<p>
One minor aim of this dissertation is to complete the documentation of
the Pandora system, and the network subsystem work for Pandora is now
over. The network principles underpinning the design need to be
implemented in other systems, such as those using H.261 video coding
(<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib42">[42]</A></B>) or MPEG-2 (<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib41">[41]</A></B>), and their performance
examined further to test their validity. The precise, accurate global
clock distribution work has only just started: this section draws
attention to a few of the areas which need more detailed work.

<p>
<A NAME="8.3.1"></A><h4>
8.3.1 Different physical layers
</h4>
<p>


<p>
The ATM Forum has currently defined 6 different physical media for ATM
transport supporting 10 different bit rates ranging from 1.544Mbps to
622.08Mbps <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib58">[58]</A></B>. Different ATM switches use different
architectures. Much more work is needed to discover how effectively
the global clock distribution can be performed outside the particular
world that the current experimentation has used. Many questions, such
as how SONET framing or low bandwidth on some links inside an ATM
switch network effect the performance of the distribution, and what
extra support for clock distribution could be implemented in switches
or nodes themselves.

<p>
<A NAME="8.3.2"></A><h4>
8.3.2 Inter-stream synchronisation
</h4>
<p>


<p>
There are standards for constant bit rate and variable bit rate
traffic streams on ATM networks. <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib61">[61]</A></B> and <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib25">[25]</A></B>
present possible strategies for admission control, and through these
delay guarantees, which may help inter-stream synchronisation. Both of
these may reduce the need for global clock distribution, but at the
same time the accuracy of the clock distribution could be improved by
the same guarantees.

<p>
<A NAME="8.3.3"></A><h4>
8.3.3 Applications of the global clock
</h4>
<p>


<p>
The main reason for an examination of the possibility of supporting a
global clock was to aid synchronisation of streams. This work still
needs to be done. Many papers have been published on the problems of
synchronisation, from the presentation level using scripts to control
computerised slide-shows, down to the inter-stream synchronisation for
real-time playback or communication of multimedia (e.g. <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib70">[70]</A></B>,
<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib53">[53]</A></B>, <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib71">[71]</A></B>). Most solutions that
are presented use some explicit form of data connection between a
synchronisation subsystem and the data sinks. With a distributed
global clock these synchronisation subsystems may be removed, and
synchronisation performed by the sinks themselves. However, the sinks
then require full knowledge of the global replay times of the various
data blocks they will receive: in a sense, they require their own
script. For real-time multimedia communications this is not a problem, but for
presentation-level synchronisation it may not be the best solution.

<p>
Additionally, there are applications made possible by the accuracy and precision of
the distributed clock that need to be examined. For example, the human
ear is extremely sensitive, and to support very high quality audio the
synchronisation between left and right speakers in stereo pairs needs
to be very accurate. With more sophisticated audio systems becoming
more widespread, with many more speakers, the synchronisation burdens
increase. Is it possible to distribute the speakers on a network,
rather than having a single audio node on the network into which all
the speakers should be plugged?

<p>
<A NAME="8.3.4"></A><h4>
8.3.4 Performance evaluation of commercial systems
</h4>
<p>


<p>
There are now quite a few multimedia communication systems
commercially available. The quality varies dramatically, from high
bandwidth motion JPEG compressed images using up to 20Mbps data rates,
to H.261 coded streams of 64kbps or Intel Indeo encoded video of
0.5Mbps. These systems are ideal subjects for performance evaluation,
perhaps using the global clock distribution to timestamp appropriate
ATM cell arrival times at switches.

<p>
<A NAME="8.4"></A><h3>
8.4 Final summary
</h3>
<p>


<p>
The results of this thesis can be summarised in three points. Firstly,
simple precise, accurate global clock distribution is not difficult
using ATM networks with a GPS clock source, and it is very
useful. Secondly, real-time multimedia communication systems based on
the principles presented in this thesis should work well, as Pandora
does. Thirdly, complex real-time distributed systems do not
necessarily work as intended, as the Pandora box, although fine-tuned
for high bandwidth video data with FIFO's between source, switch and
sink, does not perform as well as its designers believed it did: with
the ATM network card the network itself has been shown to be no longer
a bottleneck in the system, rather the video subsystem significantly
underperforms.
