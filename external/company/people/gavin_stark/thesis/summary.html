<p>
Recently there has been an explosion of interest in Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) networks as they provide scaleable high bandwidth
communication. This has introduced the capability to handle more
demanding communications such as real-time video and audio in addition
to the more common computer data traffic.  One system designed to take
advantage of these new capabilities is the Pandora box, which uses the
50Mbps Cambridge Fast Ring network or a 100Mbps fast packet switch
network to provide real-time multimedia communications. Systems like
this require careful design to achieve seamless integration of
different multimedia streams for presentation to users, particularly
at the network level.

<p>
Other technologies such as the Navstar Global Positioning System have
become available to help provide precise, accurate clock
synchronisation among distributed systems. The ability to maintain
such clocks on multimedia communication systems eases the
implementation of the inter-stream and intra-stream synchronisation
that is required of such systems.

<p>
This thesis provides a thorough examination of the Pandora box, and
presents a set of network principles for all multimedia communication
systems, from which an implementation of the network subsystem for the
Pandora box was built. The network subsystem implementation is
described in detail, then further work combines it with the Navstar
Global Positioning System to provide very accurate, very precise
global clock distribution. This allows a very detailed examination of
the operation of the Pandora boxes and how the stream handling inside
and between Pandora boxes performs. The results show that the network
principles upon which the network subsystem for Pandora was built are
fundamental to stream handling in multimedia communication systems.
