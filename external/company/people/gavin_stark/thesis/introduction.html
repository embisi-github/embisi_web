<A NAME="1"></A>Chapter 1 : Introduction</h1>

There are two main issues examined in the research for this thesis:
the handling of real-time multimedia traffic on high bandwidth ATM
networks; the accurate distribution of a precise global clock for
synchronisation and performance evaluation of these systems. The work covers an
examination of real networks carrying real-time multimedia
traffic between Pandora boxes. Timing of these
experiments is achieved using the global clock, which in turn is
derived from global positioning system hardware. The advantages of using
global timestamping are looked at, as well as the
methods of distributing this global clock around various networks
with high accuracy.

1.1 Perspective
</h3>
<p>


<p>
Recently there has been an explosion of interest in Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) networks (<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib36">[36]</A></B>, <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib48">[48]</A></B>) as they
provide scaleable high bandwidth communication between computers and
distributed computer systems. This has introduced the capability to
handle more demanding communications such as real-time video and audio
in addition to the more common computer data traffic. The traffic can
then be divided into two forms: burst data and continuous data. The
burst data consists of, for example, file transfer and database
accesses, and such traffic needs to be transferred as quickly as
possible without interfering with continuous data traffic. Continuous
data provides a constant stream of information, for example from a
video camera or an analogue-to-digital converter, and so the
information has the additional quality of time.

<p>
The extra temporal information in continuous data is usually included
with timestamps, which are a measure of the time at which the sample
of continuous data to which they refer was captured. These timestamps
may be implied from a sequence number and sample rate, or times
relative to the start of capture or some similar epoch, or perhaps
absolute times (i.e. relative to a standard epoch, for example the
first of January 1900 at 00:00).

1.2 Multimedia communication systems
</h3>
<p>


<p>
A prolific source of continuous data is a multimedia system. Multimedia is a
term which describes `containing many forms of media', covering any data such
as computer generated graphics, photographic images, video sequences, and
samples of audio. The term tends to be abused to the extent that it is used
to refer to purely text, still video images, and audio samples, but its
wider use encompasses any information media. Multimedia communication
systems <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib45">[45]</A></B>, or distributed multimedia systems <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib37">[37]</A></B>,
 use a network to communicate some forms of multimedia data: a video
phone system would be an example. <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib69">[69]</A></B> provides a very good
overview of the requirements of such systems.

<p>
A practical multimedia communications system is the Olivetti
Pandora Box (<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib72">[72]</A></B>, <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib7">[7]</A></B>, <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib46">[46]</A></B>),
 which uses an ATM network as a communication subsystem.
The Pandora Box provides multiple streams of video and audio for
replay, and can capture continuous data from a single video source and
a single audio source. Coupled with a host workstation it can then
provide real-time video conferencing and access to and generation of
video mail. All the video and audio data is handled by the Pandora
Box, including the communications, while the host workstation provides
a user interface under UNIX and X windows. Video data is captured by
the Pandora box from a standard video camera. The frames of video
(individual video samples) are captured at 25 Hz, as defined by the
PAL broadcast system, in 256 grey levels. The audio samples are
generated by a telephone quality CODEC at 8000 Hz.

<p>
A further development by Olivetti Research has been the Medusa system
<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib66">[66]</A></B>, which uses high performance workstations with hardware
additions to display high quality video images. Video capture is
performed, again at 25 Hz, in full colour and with large images, by
special systems with dedicated network connections. Audio is captured
and replayed by an additional system, again with its own dedicated
network connection, using compact disc quality CODECs, providing two
stereo 16 bit samples at up to 48 kHz. On top of these basic systems,
hardware for compression as specified by the JPEG standard
<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib27">[27]</A></B> was developed for the video streams. To provide similar
functionality to the Pandora Box, a user is supplied with a camera and
video capture system, an audio system with microphone and speakers,
and the workstation to display the video images. The communication
system used by Medusa is a 100 Mbit ATM switch network.

<p>
Much theoretical work has also been done in this area, and other
practical systems include the Desk Area Network
<B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib39">[39]</A></B> and the Multimedia Network Interface <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib26">[26]</A></B>.

1.3 Continuous media and timestamping
</h3>
<p>


<p>
Continuous media describes continuous data for human consumption. Examples
might be a sport's radio commentary, or the data coming from a video
cassette player. Both of these examples contain a quality of time. In the
first case the time is absolute - at 2 p.m. England were 64 for 3, in
cricket. The second example has at least three different but related times.
The first is the time corresponding to the amount of tape since the
beginning of the video cassete which is being played. The second is the
absolute time at which the data was recorded onto the video casette. A
third is the absolute time the data itself was generated, or captured, in a
film or television studio. If the video source were in fact a film then the
shooting process usually takes place in `Hollywood' time, where successive
scenes may be shot (captured) out of their final order.

<p>
A similar example is a compact disc containing two classical symphonies,
and its time information. Here there are many absolute times: the time
the music was composed, the time it was played and recorded, the time the
disc was pressed, the time the data is read off the disc to be
converted to sound, and others. None of these times are stored on the disc, although an
idea of some of them may be given on the accompanying booklet. The compact
disc does store time information, however. It stores the length of each
section of music, and the position of each groups of samples within the
section. This information may be presented to the user of the compact
disc system, and it has many uses.

<p>
So before deciding on how to timestamp continuous media, it is important to
understand to what uses that information can and will be put. It might be
best, when capturing a video stream using a camera, to start with a
timestamp of zero in the first frame, and make all timestamps relative to
that. A problem occurs if, after some time of capturing, the stream is
split to be delivered to two destinations. Does the copy of the stream to
the new destination have its timestamps starting from zero, or are they
copied straight from the data in its companion stream? Another problem
occurs when trying to record continuous data from two seperate sources, for
example audio and video from a microphone and camera. When creating the
streams for recording, the timestamps can start from zero, but what about
the correlation between the audio time and the video time?

<p>
The uses of timestamps in continuous media can be split into two
areas. The first area is data capture, where all data can be
timestamped according to a common clock -- global time. The second
area is data replay, where the continuous media should be timestamped
in a manner suitable for synchronization. If the continuous media is
processed between data capture and its replay, perhaps with editting
tools, then the timestamping must be adapted appropriately <B><A HREF="bibliography.html#Bib68">[68]</A></B>.

1.4 Clock distribution
</h3>
<p>


<p>
There are many ways of distributing a timing signal for
synchronisation. Perhaps the simplest method is to get a suitable
number of very accurate clocks, atomic clocks for example. Once they
have all been synchronised, they can then be physically distributed,
one for each timestamping node. This method is more distributed clocks
than distributed timing. Another simple method is to use a broadcast
system dedicated to supplying time information and synchronization
pulses. This can be done using a piece of wire, with good results,
although physical distribution then becomes difficult. Alternatively
radio signals can be used, as with the Rugby clock system, which is supported
by the National Physics Laboratory. The accuracy achievable using a
radio system depends on extra knowledge in addition to the radio
receiver itself, as the time information distribution mechanism only
works at a finite speed, the speed of light. One hundred miles from
the radio source is about half a millisecond of inaccuracy. This error
can be partially removed if you know your distance from the radio
source, and this is the solution chosen for this thesis. The
Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) uses satellites to transmit coded
signals to triangulate the position of a receiver. The satellites use
atomic clocks, and include time information in the coded signal they
transmit. Most Navstar GPS receivers can produce precise timing
information to an accuracy better than one microsecond.

1.5 Objective of work
</h3>
<p>


<p>
With the expansion in multimedia communication systems at Olivetti Research, and
in particular the increase in availability of high performance ATM
networks, it was seen that the handling of continuous media in real-time
was important. The Pandora project showed that real-time video and audio
streams could be manipulated and communicated with few sophisticated
algorithms to cope with network jitter and delay, if the Cambridge Fast
Ring (CFR) were used as the physical network. One of the big questions
hanging over the Pandora system was why did it work? The Pandora system
consists of six Transputers, with internal communication between these
processors being handled by the INMOS OS-links and FIFOs, making a complicated
multiprocessing system. The five seperate cards which make the Pandora
system were designed and programmed by different people, with the
interaction between the cards not well understood.

<p>
A major aim of the work was to understand what permitted the Pandora system
to provide user satisfaction, in terms of synchronisation, latency and
corruption of video and audio streams due both to the network
communications and internal continuous media management. To effectively
evaluate the internal performance of a Pandora system, and to monitor the
interactions between two or more seperate Pandora systems, some precise
accurate clock distribution software was proposed. The solution decided on
for this clock distribution was a simple broadcast system ideally suited to
the Cambridge Fast Ring network, which used a single clock source node.
With the migration of the Pandora system onto a heterogeneous internetwork
it became necessary to synchronise more than one of these nodes, so that
internetwork delays could be measured. Thereafter the ATM switch
network supplied other challenges.

<p>
Synchronising physically distant clock source nodes could be done in
many ways, but the solution decided on was to use the GPS system to
provide a precise accurate global clock to wherever the clock source
node happened to be. This leads to a clock node's accuracy in the
order of microseconds, which fortunately fits well with the accuracy
of distribution of time around the networks.
