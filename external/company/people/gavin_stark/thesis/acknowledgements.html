<p>
I would like to thank my supervisor, Andy Hopper, for all the support
he has provided, academically, financially, and in coffee through
Olivetti Research Laboratory. All the staff at ORL have helped me in my
work in many ways, but particularly David Clarke and Alan Jones have
never stopped looking out for me. I must thank Advanced
Telecommunication Modules Limited for allowing me time to complete
the dissertation, despite the workload requirements of a start-up
company. Without my family and friends, whose belief in me has always
given me confidence to continue, I would be lost, so most of all I
thank them.

<p>
This work was supported by a studentship from the Science and
Engineering Research Council and also by Olivetti Research Laboratory.
