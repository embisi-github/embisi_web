Images of Cambridge (without Tcl-plugin)
</h2>

Move the mouse over the map. In some places you can click to see pictures. If you have the Tcl-Plugin and allow browser capability, see the <a href="index-tcl.html">Tcl version</a>.

<img name="CambridgeImage" src="the_map.gif" width=638 height=683 alt="Cambridge map" ismap usemap="#CambridgeMap" border=0 align=center>

<p>

This is currently a prototype. More images will come when there are sunny days. Each image is approximately 30k.

<p>

This site will not post images of the insides of the Colleges. For
that, you either have to visit their web sites, or (horror-of-horrors)
visit Cambridge. These pictures just give a taste of Cambridge, and
are deliberately kept low quality as I want the image system to fit
inside 1MB (I only have 5MB on the web server).

<p>

For those technically minded, the images were taken using a Sony
digital camera, and processed using John Bradley's xv program. The
camera compresses the images using JPEG to 56kB, and they are then
cropped and the quality further reduced (to reduce image size) by
xv. The Sony digital camera is very neat, and uses PC-card (PCMCIA)
flash cards, and stores 29 of the 'low quality' images on a 2MB
card. However, its battery only seems to last for about an hour, or,
as I walked round Cambridge, 17 pictures.

<p>

Part of the aim of these pages is to look at how feasible it is to
provide a full spatio-temporal database of images and objects of a
town, and how to interact with it. This page has been put together by
wandering round with a camera and a map. A future version will be
generated by automatically mapping as participants move around the
town using GPS, and capturing images in real time for editing at
base. Using this database a very accurate map of the town can be
generated, complete with images and details of buildings in the
area. Then it should be possible to create individual tourist guides,
where tourists decide what they want to see and can plan their route
using the images and information given.
